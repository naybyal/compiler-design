# Syntax Analysis

## Introduction
Syntax analysis, also known as parsing, is the process of analyzing a string of symbols, conforming to the rules of a formal grammar. The syntax analysis phase takes the tokens produced by the lexical analysis phase and organizes them into a syntax tree.

## Role in Compiler Design
Syntax analysis is a crucial part of the compiler design process. It ensures that the source code follows the grammatical structure of the programming language.

## Phases of Syntax Analysis
1. **Lexical Analysis**: Converts the source code into tokens.
2. **Syntax Analysis**: Constructs a parse tree from the tokens.

## Types of Parsers
1. **Top-Down Parsers**: Construct the parse tree from the top and move down.
    - Recursive Descent Parser
    - Predictive Parser (LL Parser)
2. **Bottom-Up Parsers**: Construct the parse tree from the leaves and move up.
    - Shift-Reduce Parser
    - LR Parser (SLR, LALR, Canonical LR)

## Context-Free Grammars (CFG)
A context-free grammar is a set of recursive rewriting rules used to generate patterns of strings. A CFG consists of:
- A set of terminals
- A set of non-terminals
- A set of production rules
- A start symbol

## Parse Trees and Derivations
- **Parse Tree**: A tree representation of the syntactic structure of a string according to a CFG.
- **Derivation**: A sequence of production rules applied to generate a string.

## Ambiguity in Grammars
A grammar is ambiguous if there exists a string that can have more than one parse tree. Ambiguity complicates the parsing process and must be resolved.

## Syntax-Directed Translation
Syntax-directed translation uses the parse tree to direct the translation of the source code into intermediate code.

## Error Handling in Syntax Analysis
Error handling is an essential part of syntax analysis. Common strategies include:
- Panic Mode
- Phrase-Level Recovery
- Error Productions
- Global Correction
