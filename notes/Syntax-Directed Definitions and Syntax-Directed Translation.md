# Syntax Directed Definition (SDD) and Syntax Directed Translation (SDT)

## Introduction
Syntax Directed Definitions (SDDs) and Syntax Directed Translation (SDT) are central concepts in compiler design that relate to semantic analysis and translation. SDDs associate semantic rules with grammar productions, while SDTs implement these rules to generate intermediate code or perform semantic checks.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Syntax Directed Definitions (SDD)
A Syntax Directed Definition (SDD) is a formalism used to define attributes for grammar symbols and associate semantic rules with grammar productions. Each grammar production in an SDD has a set of attributes that are either:
- **Synthesized Attributes**: Attributes that are calculated from the attributes of the symbol’s children in the parse tree.
- **Inherited Attributes**: Attributes that are calculated from the attributes of the symbol’s parent and/or siblings in the parse tree.

#### Structure of SDD
An SDD consists of:
- A context-free grammar (CFG) that defines the language structure.
- A set of attributes for each grammar symbol.
- Semantic rules that specify how to compute or propagate these attributes.

#### Example of SDD
In *Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools*, Aho et al. demonstrate an SDD for arithmetic expressions where attributes are used to store computed values of subexpressions.

### 2. Dependency Graphs
A Dependency Graph represents dependencies between attribute instances. Nodes in the graph represent attribute instances, and directed edges indicate dependencies. Dependency graphs help in evaluating attributes in the correct order.

### 3. Evaluation Order
The evaluation of attributes in SDDs depends on the structure of the dependency graph:
- **S-Attributed SDDs**: Use only synthesized attributes and can be evaluated in a single bottom-up pass.
- **L-Attributed SDDs**: Allow both synthesized and inherited attributes, provided that inherited attributes follow left-to-right ordering in the parse tree.

### 4. Applications of SDD
SDDs are used in:
- **Type Checking**: Ensuring that variables and expressions adhere to language-specific type rules.
- **Expression Evaluation**: Computing values for arithmetic and logical expressions.
- **Intermediate Code Generation**: Generating intermediate representations from syntax-directed rules.

## Syntax Directed Translation (SDT)
Syntax Directed Translation extends SDDs by allowing actions to be interleaved with grammar productions. These actions are specified alongside productions to directly influence the translation process.

### Structure of SDT
An SDT consists of:
- A CFG that defines the syntactic structure.
- Semantic actions embedded within or between production rules, which can perform operations like constructing intermediate code, performing type checking, or building symbol tables.

### Types of SDTs
1. **Postfix SDTs**: All actions are placed at the end of productions, making it easier to integrate into a parser.
2. **Embedded SDTs**: Actions are embedded at various points within the production, providing more flexibility.

### Evaluation Strategies
- **Bottom-Up SDT**: Actions are executed during a bottom-up parsing process, commonly used in LR parsers.
- **Top-Down SDT**: Actions are executed during a top-down parsing process, commonly used in LL parsers.

### Applications of SDT
SDT is essential in compiler design for:
- **Intermediate Code Generation**: Generating intermediate code directly during parsing.
- **Syntax and Semantic Error Checking**: Detecting syntactic and semantic errors on-the-fly.
- **Symbol Table Management**: Managing scope and entries in symbol tables.

## Comparison between SDD and SDT
| Feature                 | Syntax Directed Definitions (SDD)      | Syntax Directed Translation (SDT)             |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Attribute Types         | Synthesized, Inherited                | Synthesized, Inherited                       |
| Semantic Rules Location | Separate from productions             | Embedded within or alongside productions     |
| Dependency Graph        | Yes, for attribute evaluation order   | Not necessary due to immediate action execution |
| Evaluation Flexibility  | Attribute evaluation only             | Immediate actions affecting translation     |

## Summary
Syntax Directed Definitions and Syntax Directed Translation are integral to compiler design, enabling compilers to interpret the semantics of source code in a structured manner. As discussed in *Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools* by Alfred V. Aho, and other references, these methods are essential for generating intermediate code, performing type checking, and managing scopes, thus playing a critical role in building efficient and accurate compilers.
